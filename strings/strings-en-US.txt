0000000009EE.07C: Too many messages! Please wait a few seconds...
0000000009F1.07C: Use Pulse Bombs to destroy static defenses such as Torbj√∂rn's turret or Bastion in sentry configuration.
0000000009F2.07C: Have Blink or Recall ready to avoid being killed by your own Pulse Bomb.
0000000009F3.07C: Blink behind enemies to confuse them.
0000000009F4.07C: Use multiple Blinks in rapid succession to cross gaps and reach normally inaccessible areas.
0000000009F6.07C: Use Tracer's mobility to quickly reach health packs located across the map.
0000000009F8.07C: Tracer excels at skirmishing. Avoid fights where the odds are not in your favor.
0000000009F9.07C: Let your teammates create a distraction before you enter combat.
0000000009FA.07C: Symmetra's shields and Torbj√∂rn's armor packs can make up for Tracer's low maximum health.
000000000A16.07C: Save your last Blink to escape your enemy.
000000000A40.07C: If you Recall immediately after taking damage, you will regain your lost health (if you're not dead).
000000000A41.07C: Recall teleports Tracer to her location from three seconds ago. Try to predict where she will reappear.
000000000A42.07C: Try to keep track of Tracer's location at all times.
000000000A43.07C: Stay near your teammates to avoid being singled out by Tracer.
000000000A44.07C: Tracer's low health makes her vulnerable to snipers such as Widowmaker.
000000000A4E.07C: Use Shadow Step to attack the enemy from unexpected directions.
000000000A4F.07C: When approaching an unaware enemy, don't open fire too soon.
000000000A50.07C: Reaper's Hellfire shotguns are most effective at extremely close range.
000000000A51.07C: Reaper's Hellfire shotguns are most effective against large targets such as Reinhardt and Winston.
000000000A52.07C: Wraith Form removes negative status effects such as Zenyatta's Orb of Discord.
000000000A53.07C: Use Wraith Form to cross well-guarded choke points or to reach cover.
000000000A54.07C: Reaper can still pick up health packs while in Wraith Form.
000000000A55.07C: Surprise and flank enemies so you get in close.
000000000A56.07C: Death Blossom can devastate a group of enemies but, unless you catch them unaware, they can quickly focus and kill you.
000000000A65.07C: Be careful when using Wraith Form, as you could find yourself in a situation with no way out.
000000000A6B.07C: Reaper is most effective at very close range. Keep him at a distance.
000000000A6C.07C: The best counters to a Reaper's Death Blossom are to stun or kill him.
000000000A6D.07C: When a Reaper is on the enemy team, watch for him to attack from above and behind you.
000000000A6E.07C: Listen for the unique sound of Reaper's Shadow Step. He's vulnerable as he fades away and reappears.
000000000A70.07C: Avoid open spaces and areas with long sight lines as you approach your objective.
000000000A71.07C: Be careful when ambushing Widowmaker if you have low health. She can easily finish you off with her rifle in assault mode.
000000000A72.07C: If you must enter an area covered by Widowmaker, try to move unpredictably.
000000000A73.07C: Try to avoid damaging Zarya's barriers, but don't let them stop you from finishing off a low health target.
000000000A75.07C: Don't let Zarya disengage from combat when she's low health, or you will give her time to recover her shields.
000000000A76.07C: If Zarya's weapon becomes charged with high amounts of energy, consider disengaging for a short time to let it dissipate.
000000000A77.07C: Be wary of moving close to McCree while his Flashbang is available.
000000000A78.07C: Head for cover when McCree begins using Deadeye, especially if you don't know where he is.
000000000A79.07C: Keep moving while McCree's around, or you'll be an easy target for his Peacekeeper.
000000000A7A.07C: While McCree can shoot at long range targets, he is still at a disadvantage against a dedicated sniper.
000000000A7B.07C: While in sentry configuration, Bastion has an additional critical hit location on its back.
000000000A7C.07C: The first step to defeating Bastion is figuring out where it's deployed.
000000000A7E.07C: Look for alternate paths to your objective that avoid Bastion's devastating line of fire.
000000000A7F.07C: Look out for signs of a Teleporter, as it allows the enemy team to quickly reposition.
000000000A80.07C: Area of effect attacks can destroy a nest of Sentry Turrets.
000000000A81.07C: Watch out for projectiles from Symmetra's photon projector, they now explode on contact.
000000000A82.07C: Zenyatta has no escape or movement abilities, so heroes that can rapidly close distance cause problems for him.
000000000A83.07C: Although Zenyatta is invulnerable and cannot be stunned while using Transcendence, he can still be knocked away from his team.
000000000A84.07C: Orb of Discord cannot be placed on heroes located behind barriers.
000000000A85.07C: Concentrated fire will quickly eliminate Winston's Barrier Projector.
000000000A86.07C: You can avoid damage from Winston's Tesla cannon by moving through Winston and forcing him to turn rapidly to face you.
000000000A87.07C: Be aware of your surroundings when fighting Winston while his Primal Rage is active to avoid being punched off of the map to your death.
000000000A88.07C: Don't let Winston distract you from more threatening enemies.
000000000A89.07C: Turrets have a range of 40 meters, so long range attacks (like Pharah's rocket launcher) can destroy them from safety.
000000000A8A.07C: Turrets can be stunned by abilities such as Reinhardt's Charge or McCree's Flashbang.
000000000A8B.07C: If Torbj√∂rn's turret is blocking your path to the objective, look for another route.
000000000A8C.07C: Barriers can protect teammates from a turret's damage for a short time.
000000000A8D.07C: When Hanzo uses Dragonstrike, he yells out to the entire map. Listen for him to have a better chance of dodging it.
000000000A8F.07C: Avoid open spaces and areas with long sight lines as you approach your objective.
000000000A90.07C: If you must enter an area covered by Hanzo, try to move unpredictably.
000000000A91.07C: Target Mercy first. It keeps her from using Resurrect, and she's often more vulnerable than the rest of her team.
000000000A92.07C: Be careful when taking on Mercy while you have low health. Her Caduceus Blaster can do a surprising amount of damage.
000000000A93.07C: Long fights favor Mercy and her healing ability. Be aggressive and try to finish off enemies quickly.
000000000A94.07C: Reinhardt's size makes him easier to hit.
000000000A95.07C: If your team attacks Reinhardt from two directions, he can only partially defend himself with his Barrier Field.
000000000A96.07C: Coordinate your team's attacks to quickly destroy Reinhardt's Barrier Field.
000000000A97.07C: Earthshatter, Charge, and Fire Strike all have significant cooldowns. Bait Reinhardt into using them, then move in for the kill.
000000000A98.07C: Move erratically to make it more difficult for Pharah to hit you with her rocket launcher.
000000000A99.07C: Pharah stays in place when using Barrage, making her an easy target.
000000000A9A.07C: Take advantage of enclosed spaces to avoid Pharah's long range aerial attacks.
000000000AA4.07C: %1$s switched to %2$s (was %3$s).
000000000AC9.07C: A Venom Mine placed along an attacker's path can warn you of an approaching threat.
000000000ACA.07C: The best sniping positions have multiple escape routes. (And don't forget your grappling hook!)
000000000ACB.07C: The grappling hook isn't just for reaching high locations. You can use it on a wall or the floor to quickly move short distances.
000000000ACC.07C: Your vision is highly restricted while sniping. Listen for incoming threats.
000000000ACD.07C: A fully-charged critical head shot kills nearly all non-tank heroes.
000000000ACF.07C: Stay unpredictable and never stay in one sniping position for too long. 
000000000AD0.07C: Look out for enemy snipers. They are your greatest threat.
000000000AD1.07C: Don't forget to move as you aim. It makes you harder to hit.
000000000AD2.07C: Partially charged shots can finish off targets with low health.
000000000ADE.07C: Use Jump Jets and Hover to avoid static enemy defenses and set up ambushes.
000000000ADF.07C: Jump Jets can quickly move Pharah out of danger from close range heroes such as Reaper or Reinhardt.
000000000AE0.07C: Take advantage of your rocket launcher's long-range and explosive damage to destroy static defenses from relative safety.
000000000AE1.07C: Sometimes it is better to aim at the ground under your target than to attempt a direct hit.
000000000AE2.07C: Don't aim your rockets at your target's current location. Aim where you think they will be when your rocket reaches them.
000000000AE3.07C: Barrage can quickly destroy enemies who are close together, but it leaves you vulnerable to their return fire.
000000000AE4.07C: Don't pass up good opportunities to use Barrage while waiting for the "perfect" one.
000000000AE5.07C: Watch for enemy snipers while airborne. You have little cover and your movement can be easy to predict.
000000000AE6.07C: Be careful when firing a rocket at point blank range, as it will damage you as well.
000000000AF2.07C: <fg%1$s>REVIVING</fg>
000000000B05.07C: Pharah's hovering can be slow and predictable, making her vulnerable to your own long-range attacks.
000000000B06.07C: Your Rocket Hammer's swing hits all enemies in its path.
000000000B07.07C: Your Barrier Field can provide cover for your teammates, as well as yourself.
000000000B09.07C: Fire Strike penetrates through all enemies in its path, including enemy barriers.
000000000B0A.07C: Use Fire Strike against immobile targets, such as Bastion in sentry configuration or Torbj√∂rn's turret, as they can't dodge.
000000000B0B.07C: Charge stuns Torbj√∂rn's turret for a short time. Follow up with your rocket hammer.
000000000B0C.07C: Charge is a devastating follow-up to stunning an enemy with Earthshatter.
000000000B0D.07C: You can use Earthshatter while in midair. The hammer swing completes when you land.
000000000B0E.07C: You can adjust the direction of your Charge as you rocket forward.
000000000B0F.07C: Your Barrier Field's health begins to regenerate a few seconds after deactivating it.
000000000B23.07C: You can see the location and current health status of your teammates at all times, even through walls and terrain.
000000000B25.07C: Stay behind cover while attached to a teammate who is in combat.
000000000B26.07C: Mercy's health begins to regenerate a few seconds after taking damage.
000000000B27.07C: Escape danger by using Guardian Angel to fly to a distant teammate.
000000000B28.07C: After using Guardian Angel to reach an airborne Pharah, gliding can keep you away from ground-based threats.
000000000B29.07C: Don't forget about your Caduceus Blaster. It is accurate and useful for finishing off enemies with low health.
000000000B2A.07C: You are vulnerable while alone. Fall back and group up with your teammates as they respawn.
000000000B2B.07C: Resurrect is best used on teammates who were contesting a map objective.
000000000B93.07C: Dragonstrike does not damage deployable static defenses, such as Torbj√∂rn's turret, but it will damage Bastion in sentry configuration.
000000000B94.07C: Try to Dragonstrike from unpredictable angles so your enemies have less time to get away.
000000000B95.07C: Dragonstrike pairs well with abilities that restrict movement, such as Reinhardt's Earthshatter or Zarya's Graviton Surge.
000000000B96.07C: Placing a Sonic Arrow on a side route helps prevent your team from being ambushed.
000000000B97.07C: Hanzo's best sniping locations not only have a great view of the enemy, but good escape routes as well.
000000000B98.07C: Be unpredictable, and never stay in one sniping position for too long.
000000000B99.07C: Watch out for enemy snipers. They are the greatest threat to you.
000000000B9A.07C: Don't forget to move as you aim. It makes you harder to hit.
000000000B9B.07C: Partially charged shots can finish off low health targets.
000000000BB9.07C: Winston's Tesla cannon can quickly decimate a closely-placed group of Symmetra's turrets.
000000000BBA.07C: Jump Pack allows you to quickly move to the objective while avoiding enemy defenses below.
000000000BBB.07C: Winston excels at attacking snipers and support heroes by leaping onto them from a distance and finishing them with his Tesla cannon.
000000000BBC.07C: Winston leaps in the direction of his targeting reticle when using Jump Pack. By looking up, he can jump nearly straight up and land where he took off.
000000000BBD.07C: You can use directional movement for limited air control while using Jump Pack.
000000000BBE.07C: Deploy a Barrier Projector on the objective to protect teammates who are contesting it.
000000000BBF.07C: Winston can move in and out of his Barrier Projector's sphere to keep it between himself and an enemy hero with short range attacks.
000000000BC0.07C: Winston can take a lot of damage, but his size makes him easy to hit. Heroes that wield shotgun-style weapons are particularly dangerous.
000000000BC1.07C: Activating Primal Rage completely heals Winston. Try to wait until you reach low health before using it.
000000000BC2.07C: Use Primal Rage to disrupt the enemy team by leaping onto enemies and punching them away.
000000000BC3.07C: You can see the location and current health status of your teammates at all times, even through walls and terrain.
000000000BC4.07C: Always keep your Orb of Harmony on a teammate, even if everyone is at full health.
000000000BC5.07C: Always try to keep your Orb of Discord on an enemy, prioritizing enemies who are attacking you.
000000000BC6.07C: When your Orb of Discord is on an enemy, you can see their location, even through walls.
000000000BC7.07C: Use cover to charge your Orbs of Destruction. You're vulnerable when you attack.
000000000BC8.07C: Keep your enemies at a healthy distance. You have no easy means of escaping if they reach you.
000000000BC9.07C: Although Zenyatta is a support hero, his Orbs of Destruction are powerful long-range weapons.
000000000BCA.07C: Watch out for enemy snipers. Your low health and shields make you a target.
000000000BCB.07C: Use Transcendence to counter area of effect abilities, such as Zarya's Graviton Surge.
000000000BCC.07C: Use Transcendence to save yourself from immediate danger, then retreat to your team for support.
000000000BCF.07C: The photon projector's beam remains fully empowered even if you quickly switch targets after it reaches maximum charge.
000000000BD0.07C: The projectile from the photon projector's alternate fire explodes on contact, dealing damage to nearby enemy targets.
000000000BD2.07C: Use your Photon Barrier to protect your team from snipers as they approach the objective.
000000000BD3.07C: When placing your Teleporter, use locations near your current objective but hidden from the enemy.
000000000BD4.07C: A single Sentry Turret is not much of a threat, but several of them together creates a deadly trap.
000000000BD5.07C: Keep your Sentry Turrets out of view. Place them high on walls or on ceilings.
000000000BD8.07C: The best locations for sentry configuration have walls or terrain that protect your flanks but still provide a good view.
000000000BD9.07C: Don't stay in sentry configuration in one place for too long, or your enemy will adapt and gain the upper hand.
000000000BDA.07C: Your sentry configuration's cannon does immense damage, especially to large targets like tank heroes and barriers.
000000000BDB.07C: Use Self-Repair to keep yourself at full health and armor between engagements.
000000000BDC.07C: Try to avoid having to reload during combat while in sentry configuration.
000000000BDD.07C: Use sentry configuration at locations that have a view of your objective.
000000000BDE.07C: If engaging an enemy while in recon configuration, it's usually better to fight than to switch into sentry configuration.
000000000BDF.07C: Use tank configuration when you need to take the fight to the enemy. Don't just wait for them to come to you.
000000000BE1.07C: McCree's Peacekeeper is extremely accurate and has a very long range. If you can see it, you can shoot it.
000000000BE2.07C: Peacekeeper's alternate fire quickly shoots the remaining rounds in the weapon, so try to stay fully loaded.
000000000BE3.07C: Although the Peacekeeper's alternate fire shoots wildly, it can still be effective at close range or against large targets, such as Reinhardt.
000000000BE4.07C: Performing a Combat Roll also reloads the Peacekeeper.
000000000BE5.07C: After your Flashbang stuns an enemy, use the Peacekeeper's alternate fire, Combat Roll, and then fire again.
000000000BE6.07C: Stunning an enemy with Flashbang makes it easy to aim for a critical shot to the head.
000000000BE7.07C: Avoid enemy attacks by using Combat Roll to dodge behind cover.
000000000BE8.07C: Try to initate Deadeye from behind cover, then move into line of sight afterwards to target your enemies.
000000000BE9.07C: You can pull the trigger on Deadeye before its targeting reticles completely lock on, but the shots will not deal killing blows.
000000000BEA.07C: Enemy barriers can block the shots from Deadeye.
000000000BEB.07C: The particle cannon's primary fire is Zarya's highest damage attack, but its range is short and requires direct aim.
000000000BEC.07C: Use the particle cannon's secondary fire to engage enemies at longer distances, or at enemies standing close to each other.

000000000CBD.07C: The Heavy Pulse Rifle can hit enemies at nearly any distance but excels at medium range.
000000000CBE.07C: Fire the Heavy Pulse Rifle in short bursts to be more accurate.
000000000CBF.07C: It is often better to aim at the ground under your target with Helix Rockets than to attempt a direct hit.

000000000CC9.07C: When Soldier: 76 activates Tactical Visor, immediately seek cover. If you're caught out in the open, try to kill him before he kills you.

000000000D5D.07C: Since L√∫cio can heal himself over time, try to finish him off with a short and powerful burst of damage.
000000000D5E.07C: As a support hero, L√∫cio is always a high priority target.
000000000D5F.07C: L√∫cio needs line of sight to his teammates for his abilities to work on them, so try to separate him from his team.

0000000019F0.07C: Try to keep a height advantage over Junkrat. He's much less effective if he has to aim up.
0000000019F1.07C: Damage a Steel Trap on the ground to safely destroy it.
0000000019F2.07C: Stay away from a dying Junkrat to avoid Total Mayhem's grenades.
0000000019F3.07C: Listen for a RIP-Tire and try to shoot it before it gets too close.
0000000019F4.07C: D.Va's mech has short range and moves slowly while shooting. Keep it at a distance.
0000000019F5.07C: Attack D.Va's mech from multiple angles to outmaneuver her Defense Matrix.
0000000019F6.07C: Self-Destruct has a huge area of effect. Get to cover!
0000000019F7.07C: Quickly take out D.Va after she ejects from her mech to prevent her from calling down another.
0000000019F8.07C: Genji's mobility allows him to attack from any angle, so make sure to watch your surroundings at all times.
0000000019F9.07C: When you see or hear Genji using Deflect, don't attack him or you will risk dying to your own attacks.
0000000019FA.07C: Attack Mei from farther away, where her Endothermic Blaster cannot reach.
0000000019FB.07C: Try to single out Mei, so that if she freezes you, her teammates cannot take advantage.
0000000019FD.07C: Fight Mei with your teamates nearby. She can't easily freeze more than one hero with her primary weapon.
0000000019FE.07C: Use Frag Launcher's high arc and bouncy grenades to attack enemies from behind cover.
0000000019FF.07C: The Frag Launcher excels at destroying immobile targets, such as Torbj√∂rn's turret, Bastion, or enemies caught in a Steel Trap.
000000001A00.07C: Attack enemies in enclosed areas to increase the chance that your missed shots still do damage.
000000001A01.07C: Detonate a Concussion Mine at your feet to launch yourself into the air, reaching higher areas.
000000001A02.07C: Use your Concussion Mine to knock away approaching enemies, or to knock yourself out of danger.
000000001A03.07C: You can detonate a Concussion Mine in midair to damage airborne heroes.
000000001A04.07C: Place a Steel Trap around corners or in other locations where the enemy can't see it until it's too late.
000000001A05.07C: Fighting around one of your Steel Traps can give you an advantage fighting at close range.
000000001A06.07C: You are completely vulnerable while using RIP-Tire. Stay out of sight of the enemy!
000000001A07.07C: The RIP-Tire can climb over walls or drive from behind cover, making it harder for enemies to spot.
000000001A08.07C: Try to die next to an enemy so that they'll be damaged by Total Mayhem.
000000001A09.07C: Shuriken are highly accurate even at very long ranges, allowing Genji to attack anyone he sees on the battlefield.
000000001A0A.07C: Fan of Blades is useful at short range, especially against large targets such as tank heroes.
000000001A0B.07C: Use Deflect to defend yourself when caught in the open and you don't have Swift Strike or an escape route available.
000000001A0C.07C: Aim at enemies when using Deflect to hit them with their own attacks.
000000001A0D.07C: Be careful when using Swift Strike to engage an enemy. It can leave you without a means of escape.
000000001A0E.07C: Swift Strike's cooldown resets if you kill a target, allowing you to finish them off then escape.
000000001A0F.07C: You can Swift Strike into the air, allowing you to reach high ledges and other hard-to-reach locations.
000000001A10.07C: Use Cyber-Agility's mobility to surprise enemies from unexpected locations and escape from bad situations.
000000001A11.07C: If you can surprise your opponents with Dragonblade, its immense damage can quickly decimate a group of enemies.
000000001A13.07C: After killing someone with Dragonblade, use Swift Strike to quickly move within range of the next target.
000000001A14.07C: Overwatch Dark
000000001A20.07C: D.Va's fusion cannons do not need to be reloaded, but have a short effective range and slow her movement considerably.
000000001A21.07C: D.Va cannot follow targets very well while firing her fusion cannons. Try to get as close as possible before firing.
000000001A22.07C: The fusion cannons fire rapidly in a shotgun-like spread. They're very effective against larger heroes, such as Winston or Reinhardt.
000000001A23.07C: Use D.Va's Boosters to fly around tanks and other obstacles, then attack more vulnerable targets.
000000001A24.07C: Flying through enemies with Boosters will knock them back and also deal enough damage to finish off low health targets.
000000001A25.07C: D.Va can protect herself and her allies from enemies in front of her using Defense Matrix.
000000001A26.07C: After your mech is destroyed, fight aggressively with your Light Gun to charge your ultimate and get a new mech.
000000001A27.07C: The Self-Destruct ultimate turns your mech into a walking bomb but, after ejecting, you can immediately summon a new one.
000000001A28.07C: Use Self-Destruct to clear enemies away from a map objective. Even if it doesn't kill, it forces them to move away.
000000001A29.07C: If you use Self-Destruct after activating Boosters, D.Va will eject but her mech will continue to move forward before detonating.

0000000040F6.07C: PCRE2 LICENCE
-------------
PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as specified below. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.
The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when the library is built.

0000000044E6.07C: SETTINGS
0000000044EE.07C: Always be on the move. Don't make it easy for Roadhog to grab you with his Chain Hook.
0000000044EF.07C: Try to stay far away from Roadhog to avoid the huge damage from his Scrap Gun.
0000000044F0.07C: When you see a Roadhog at low health, be sure to finish him off quickly before he can use Take a Breather.
0000000044F1.07C: Roadhog's large size makes him particularly easy to hit, allowing shotgun weapons like Reaper's to do devastating damage up close.
0000000044F2.07C: The Scrap Gun can do immense damage up close, especially to larger targets such as Reinhardt or Winston.
0000000044F3.07C: The Scrap Gun's alternate fire does not deal much damage on a hit until the scrap ball explodes at its fixed distance.
0000000044F4.07C: The Scrap Gun does not hold much ammunition, so try to keep it fully loaded with well timed reloading.
0000000044F5.07C: Ambush players from behind cover or from a flanking position so that they're less likely to notice you and dodge your Chain Hook.
0000000044F6.07C: When choosing targets for your Chain Hook, try to grab a less mobile Support or Defense Hero. They're easier to kill with your Scrap Gun.
0000000044F7.07C: Always look for opportunities to briefly duck behind cover and use Take a Breather to recover any missing health.
0000000044F9.07C: Whole Hog can quickly push enemy players away from an objective, giving your team an opportunity to claim it uncontested.
0000000044FA.07C: There is a short delay before you begin spewing scrap after activating Whole Hog, so try to use it aggressively instead of waiting until you're low on health.
0000000044FB.07C: Whole Hog does immense damage at very close targets, so you can quickly kill someone if you can keep them knocked into a wall or corner.

00000000543C.07C: Mei's Snowball Blaster only has one shot, but one hit eliminates an enemy!
00000000543D.07C: Look for snow piles on the ground to reload your Snowball Blaster.
00000000543E.07C: Use Ice Wall and Cryo-Freeze to block incoming snowballs!
00000000544A.07C: Endothermic blaster isn't just for dealing damage. Its freeze can also limit your enemy's ability to attack you.
00000000544B.07C: Your primary weapon is best used against highly mobile heroes. When slowed, they are more easily taken out.
00000000544C.07C: Use Endothermic blaster's secondary fire to finish off frozen targets.
00000000544D.07C: Endothermic blaster's secondary fire is accurate at long range.
00000000544E.07C: Cancel Cryo-Freeze early to surprise enemies and disrupt the timing of their attacks.
00000000544F.07C: In addition to making yourself invulnerable, you can use Cryo-Freeze to heal yourself in a pinch.
000000005450.07C: Use Ice Wall defensively to provide you and your team cover from enemy attacks.
000000005451.07C: Ice Wall can be used to separate your enemies, giving you and your own team a huge advantage.
000000005452.07C: Placing an Ice Wall under you or your teammate will move them to the top of the wall, giving them access to higher areas.
000000005453.07C: Blizzard is not a deadly attack, but it can freeze your enemies so they cannot avoid attacks from your team.
000000005454.07C: Use Blizzard to deny a strategic area from the enemy, such as a map objective or a key pathway.
000000005455.07C: Place an Ice Wall to give yourself cover before reloading at a snow pile.
000000005456.07C: Launching a snowball at long range is very risky.
000000005457.07C: Try to block the enemy's snowballs, then move closer for your shot.
000000005458.07C: Once you've used your snowball, you're extremely vulnerable.
000000005459.07C: Be careful of doors and corners. Someone could be hiding!
00000000545A.07C: Be wary of reloading at snow piles out in the open. Look for one with better cover.
00000000545B.07C: It's easiest to hit an enemy when they are stationary and reloading at a snow pile.
00000000545C.07C: Snow piles appear randomly.
00000000545D.07C: Before using your snowball, try to identify a path of retreat leading to a snow pile.
00000000545E.07C: You can rapidly launch snowballs with Flurry, but save a snowball before it runs out.

000000005996.07C: Place a Protective Barrier in key doorways and chokepoints to help your team move through them safely.
000000005997.07C: Use the long range of the Fusion Driver to suppress dangerous enemies and destroy enemy barriers.
000000005998.07C: Fortify prevents many deadly abilities from affecting you, including Roadhog's Hook and Reinhardt's Charge.

00000000D19A.07C: PCRE2 LICENCE
-------------
PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the ""BSD"" licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the ""doc"" directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain. The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when the library is built.
